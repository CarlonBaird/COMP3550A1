						<cite>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the sun. About half the light reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of infrared heat. About 90 percent of this heat is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface, which is warmed to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).</cite>

			<p>Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" â€” warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.</p>
			<p>Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."</p>
			
			<h2>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</h2>

			<table class="table table-hover">
	  			<tr>
	  				<th>Water vapour</th>
	  				<td>The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapour increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.</td>
	  			</tr>

	  			<tr>
	  				<th>Carbon dioxide</th>
	  				<td>A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration by a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.</td>
	  			</tr>

	  			<tr>
	  				<th>Methane</th>
	  				<td>A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.</td>
	  			</tr>
	  			
	  			<tr>
	  				<th>Nitrous oxide</th>
	  				<td>A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilisers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.</td>
	  			</tr>

	  			<tr>
	  				<th>Chlorofluorocarbons</td>
	  				<td>Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.</td>
	  			</tr>
